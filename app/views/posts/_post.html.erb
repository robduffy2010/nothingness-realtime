<%-# Load all images and their respective opening posts, one by one.  This is basically a for loop that outputs an image and a post every cycle.  The first "image" in image.image.url, is actually a built in Paperclip variable, so that's probably why you're confused about where it came from -%>

<b>Anonymous</b> <%= post.created_at %> - Post ID:<%= link_to post.id, post_path(post.id) %> </br>
<%= if post.image.present? ; then link_to image_tag(post.image.url), post_path(post.id ) end %>

<%= post.opening_post %>
